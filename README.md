### let me introduce myself: I'm 19 years old, I'm currently studying systems analysis and development at UNISENAC University 3/6. I currently work at VSINFO SISTEMAS as a software support analyst.

### Since my first contact with games when i was 8 years old, I have always been fascinated by the commands/codes that we can use to access particularities within the game. An example that struck me was the "time_set_0 or time_set_1" command in Minecraft, in which we could change the weather conditions, whereas in normal game use we could not do so.

### Since then, i've been learning about programming languages and programming logic, with intention of find create solutions for any issues that i may have.  

### My skills:
