My name is Vitor Veiga and I am 19 years old. I am currently studying systems analysis and development at UNISENAC University. I currently work at VSINFO SISTEMAS as a software support analyst.

Since my first contact with games when i was 10 years old, I have always been fascinated by the commands/codes that we can use to access particularities within the game. An example that struck me was the "time_set_0 or time_set_1" command in Minecraft, in which we could change the weather conditions, whereas in normal game use we could not do so. Since then, i've been learning about programming languages and programming logic, with intention of find create solutions for any issues that i may have.
